# void-66-services
66 service frontends for voidlinux

Most frontends are heavily based on the corresponding services run scripts in 
the [void-packages](https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages) repository 
(BSD-2-Clause license). Some of them are based on the 
[original Obarun services](https://framagit.org/pkg/observice) which are under 
the ISC license.
